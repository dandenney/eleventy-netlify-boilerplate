  "intro": "The two girls were great friends, enjoying a day off from school. Family dropped them off for a local hike and arranged to pick them up later. During their time out, Libby recorded video and photos of a man walking across a bridge and recorded audio of a man instructing them to go \"down the hill\". There may be more photos and videos, but those are what have been released so far.",
  "summary": "Abby and Libby went for a hike on February 13, 2017. They didn't show up to be picked up, and their bodies were found the next day.",
