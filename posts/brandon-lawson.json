  "intro": "There is about a 40-minute window in Brandon's life that leads to so many questions. In the time between calling his brother Kyle to bring him gas and Kyle arriving, Brandon called 911, asking for \"the cops\" to \"please hurry.\" In another call to Kyle's girlfriend, Brandon said he was bleeding and that he was 10 minutes up the road. The last known ping from his cell phone was from a tower 3 miles away from the scene, and his family has been looking for him ever since. We're only left with questions: What happened to Brandon that night? Was he in danger from people in the area or was he delusional? Where is he now?",
