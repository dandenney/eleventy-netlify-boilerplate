  "intro": "Sadly, on August 9, 2010, human remains were found, which were later confirmed to be Matrice.  In the months before she was found and continually afterward, an overwhelming number of contradictions and negligence by the police department came to light. The family eventually won a settlement based on the negligence of the department, but there are still no answers as to what happened to Mitrice. How did she end up deep in a wooded area, and how did she die?",
  "summary": "Mitrice Richardson walked out of the Lost Hills Sheriff Station at approximately 12:28 a.m. on September 16, 2009, and went missing.",
